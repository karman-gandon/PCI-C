**What is the PCI-C?**

I came up with creating a high-speed connector for connecting monitors, external graphics cards, and other peripherals. I've designed the connector model, and now you'll be able to produce a cable using PCI-C technology.

Additionally, you can produce a PCI-e -> PCI-C expansion card. It connects to PCI-e x1 and provides the opportunity to alternatively connect PCI-e devices.

The model has been created, and the dimensions are known. Everything is in your hands now!
